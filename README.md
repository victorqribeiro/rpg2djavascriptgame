# RPG 2D JavaScript Game
Engine for a 2D JavaScript rpg game I was making.

You can see a short version of the game online in http://www.victorribeiro.com/hero

Here is how the game will look: http://victorribeiro.com/rpg/

And here is the Map Generator I was doing: http://victorribeiro.com/rpg/map_gen/ 

To use the map_gen, you have to click on one pieace of tile on the right and then click again on the empty tile on the left, where you would want it to be. Then you have to copy the "array" generated below and paste it on the "mapa" array inside test.js script.

Just trying to see if anyone cares for this project at all.

You can talk to me on victorqribeiro@gmail.com

Cheers,
