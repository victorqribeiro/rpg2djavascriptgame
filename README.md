# RPG 2D JavaScript Game
Engine for a 2D JavaScript rpg game I was making.

You can see the game online in http://www.victorribeiro.com/hero

This was my first attempt to create something like that. So, after that, I made a MAP generator so te user can draw the maps and make news levels.

I'll post it in here soon, just trying to see if anyone cares for this project at all.

You can talk to me on victorqribeiro@gmail.com

Cheers,
